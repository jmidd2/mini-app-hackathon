# Socket To-Do

Use Socket.IO to create a real-time todo list with a chat.

## Description

After entering a name a user should be able to see the lists created already or create a new list.
As lists are created the table will update. When viewing either a new or previous list a user will be able to add items.
As items are added the list is updated for everybody. The item and list will show who updated it and when.

## Stretch Goals

There will be a chat available to communicate with other connected users.
